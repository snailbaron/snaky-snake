DISCLAIMER

Being a snake is not a simple way of living. You'd better be 21+ to face this
tough life. This game is not for kids, you know.


Snaky Snake

Be a snake inside Vim!


But how can I become a snake?!?
-------------------------------
(how to run)

1. Open snake.vim in Vim
2. Open another buffer in the same Vim:
    :tabe test.txt
   This will be your snake space!
3. Switch back to snake.vim:
    gT
4. Let the snake power come inside of you, by loading its functions:
    :so %
5. Switch back to your snake space:
    gt
6. Let your snake life begin!
    :call Run()


But what can I do as a snake?!?
-------------------------------
(how to play)

Not much, my friend, but be humble, and do what must be done:
    * Collect the food on the field by rushing into it with all your might!
    * Be careful not to rush into a wall, or your snake life will end instantly.


But why is my snake acting so strange?!?!?!
-------------------------------------------
(known bugs)

Oh, there are a lot of reasons, my friend. You may have noticed the following
mysteries:
    * You, as a snake, is dying when not even touching a wall, or even
      stranger, you can pass through a wall with no damage taken.
    * The food is appearing in strange places.
    * Your snake seems tired, or drunk, or maybe even high (the game is not
      for kids, remember?), and it's tricky to control the beast. It's very
      slow as well.

Giving a life to a snake is no piece of cake, so just accept your faith and do
what must be done (see above).
[ I've had enough of vim script, and probably will not bother myself fixing the
bugs, so you are all alone with this buggy masterpiece. ]

But hey, tough guy, your faith is in your own hands! Take control of your
actions and become the ruler of your own world!
[ In case you want to fix some bugs, or introduce some improvements -- you're
welcome. The code should give you a good idea on how it can be done in
VimScript ]


It's all so clear now, thanks to this comprehensive manual!
-----------------------------------------------------------

Thanks, buddy. Now go and live your new life as a snake inside Vim.
